# Smart Hospital Appointment System 💻🏥

This is a basic PHP-based hospital appointment booking system that allows users to register, log in, book appointments, and view health tips. It is designed as a simple web project for learning and demonstration purposes.

- `register.php` – Allows new users to sign up for an account.
- `login.php` – Login page for existing users.
- `logut.php` – Logs out the user and destroys the session.
- `aboutus.php` – Contains information about the hospital or development team.
- `bookappointment.php` – Main page to book an appointment with a doctor.
- `book.php` – Backend logic for booking appointments (likely processes form submission).
- `healthtips.php` – Displays useful health tips for users.
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS – Front-end design
- PHP – Backend logic
